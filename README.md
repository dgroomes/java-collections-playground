ðŸ“š Learning and experimenting with the Java Collections Framework.

---

The *Java Collections Framework* is the name that Java uses, but I'm not sure I've ever heard this name used in conversation.
Instead, I just think about Java's standard library classes like `List`, `Set`, `Iterator`, etc. 

## Instructions

* Use Java 16
* Build and run the program:
  * `java src/dgroomes/Main.java`
  * Alternatively, execute it from within an IDE like Intellij.
  * It should print:
    ```
    CountingIterator{elementsVisited=1} message: 'Hello'
    CountingIterator{elementsVisited=2} message: 'there,'
    CountingIterator{elementsVisited=3} message: 'world!'
    ```

## Reference

* [*The Java Tutorials: Trail Collections*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/)
  * As always, Java's official guideâ€“*The Java Tutorials*â€“are a great way to learn about core features of Java.
